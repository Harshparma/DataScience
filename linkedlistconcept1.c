//previous name isliye raha kyoki me use prevous node ke baad insert karna chahta hu. Here agar head nhi bhi le to chalega ham uske bigar connect kar sakte h jo mere node given h uske baad 1 naya data bana k usko connect kar dunga linked list ke bicho bich. But ham head le rahe h just for simplicity purpose.
